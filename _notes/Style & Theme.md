I'm writing these notes as I start to develop the custom CSS for this template.

I'm removing the SCSS because I'm a big fan of pure CSS variables. I'm also removing [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) because it was last updated in 2018, and a lot has changed since then. I'm a bit of a minimalist when it comes to CSS and working with browser defaults.

The new stylesheet will live in `assets/css`, organized according to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/). I also added an empty `js` folder just in case and an `images` folder for attachments. This way all assets are automatically built to `_site` without the need for additional configuration.
